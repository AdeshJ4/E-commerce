Keywords: 


1. Developer Account & Sandbox Mode:
Free: There are no charges to create a PayPal Developer account or use the sandbox for testing.
Sandbox accounts allow you to simulate payments without real money being involved.


2. Live Transactions (Real Environment):
When you move to the live mode (i.e., real transactions), PayPal will charge transaction fees for every successful payment 
processed through their gateway.
Fees Structure (Example for India):
Typically, PayPal charges around 2.9% + a fixed fee per transaction. The fixed fee varies depending on the currency.
For international payments, there may be additional cross-border fees.
These fees are charged to the merchant account (business account), meaning you as the seller will bear these costs.


3. No Monthly or Setup Fees:
PayPal does not charge monthly fees for maintaining a business account.
You only pay fees when a transaction occurs in live mode.


4. Free Until You Go Live:
While in sandbox mode, you can test all functionalities without incurring any costs.


5. PayPal Sandbox Test Environment: 
The sandbox refers to the PayPal Sandbox Test Environment, where you can create test accounts (personal and business) to simulate 
real-world transactions without involving actual money.

Sandbox Accounts:
When you create a PayPal Developer account, you can access the sandbox environment.
You can set up two types of test accounts:
Personal Account: Simulates a customer/buyer account.
Business Account: Simulates a merchant/seller account.

Test Transactions:
You can use these accounts to test payments, refunds, disputes, subscriptions, etc., without any real financial impact.
All interactions in the sandbox are purely virtual and for testing purposes.

Sandbox Credentials:
PayPal will provide you with sandbox API credentials (client ID and secret) that you can use in your application for testing 
payment integrations.

Switch to Live:
When you're ready to process real transactions, you can replace the sandbox credentials with live API credentials.
